## 🎯 What I Do

I'm a **B.Tech student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** at **IIIT Naya Raipur**, specializing in **production-grade AI systems, agentic architectures, and full-stack engineering**. My work focuses on building AI systems that go beyond proof-of-concepts to real-world deployment.

I started coding in **Class 9 during COVID** and have since evolved from basic applications to **secure, scalable AI systems** with strong engineering foundations. My approach combines **deep AI research understanding** with **rigorous software engineering principles** — security, system design, and scalability.

## 💻 Computer Science Fundamentals (Current Focus)

I'm currently strengthening my **CS foundations** to build more robust AI systems:

**Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Deep understanding of **trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables, and tries**
- Algorithm design: **dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking**
- Complexity analysis and optimization techniques
- Active competitive programming practice

**System Design & Architecture**
- Designing **scalable microservices** with load balancing and caching
- Understanding **database normalization, indexing, and query optimization**
- Building **distributed systems** with message queues and event-driven architectures
- API design patterns and RESTful principles

**Operating Systems & Networking**

## 📈 What Sets Me Apart

**Depth Over Breadth**: I don't just use AI libraries—I understand the math, architectures, and engineering behind them. I've fine-tuned models, built custom retrieval systems, and designed multi-agent orchestration from scratch.

**Engineering Rigor**: Every AI system I build has proper error handling, security layers, monitoring, and is designed for production. I understand that 80% of AI engineering is traditional software engineering done right.

**Research to Production**: I bridge the gap between academic papers and deployed systems. I read research, implement it, optimize it, and ship it with proper engineering practices.

**Systems Thinking**: I approach AI problems with a systems mindset—considering latency, cost, security, scalability, and maintainability from day one, not as afterthoughts.
